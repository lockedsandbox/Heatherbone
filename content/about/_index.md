            description: "Whether I'm wandering through the bustling streets of a new city or taking in the quiet beauty of an unfamiliar landscape, I love making the most of every place I visit. From my first desert adventure to catching waves at the beach, I’m always excited to explore what’s different from my own surroundings. Travel fuels my curiosity and gives me a chance to dive into the best experiences a place has to offer."

            description: "A few years ago, I began sewing, starting with simple projects and now creating full garments. The jacket in the picture above is one I quilted using materials I bought second-hand—pieces like this let me create something entirely unique. Sewing has become a way for me to relax and express myself, blending creativity with sustainability. I love repurposing materials, showing the potential of turning something old into something new, and making pieces I couldn’t find anywhere else. Just like research, sewing involves creativity and the satisfaction of building something original from the ground up."

            description: "My companion since the start of my PhD journey. She’s been with me through every high and low, and after a long day at the office, she’s always there to greet me. I love hearing about the special bonds others have with their pets, so feel free to share your stories with me!"
